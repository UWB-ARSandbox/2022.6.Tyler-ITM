# SAR GPS Track Processing Tool

Welcome to the SAR GPS Track Processing Tool repository! This tool is designed to expedite the GPS track processing in Search and Rescue (SAR) missions. By swiftly calculating the Total Track Line Length (TLL), it enhances the efficiency of SAR operations. This repository houses the source code for four key components integral to this tool.

# Contents:

- HeightxAreaEstimate

    This is an experimental package being developed alongside the main project. HeightxAreaEstimate queries elevation values for coordinate points, utilizing the IntersectionSupport algorithm layer. It aims to enhance terrain data processing and coverage estimation capabilities.

- IntersectionSupport 
    This package houses the algorithm that determines the intersection between the GPS track and the defined search area. It forms the backbone of our tool, enabling the precise calculation of the Total Track Line Length (TLL) within search areas.

- WaSARxCLI
    The WaSARxCLI package provides a command-line interface for our tool. Executable files are available in this directory for those who prefer or require a command-line interface, enhancing the tool's accessibility and usability.

- WaSARxGUI
    The WaSARxGUI package provides a graphical user interface for our tool. Executable files are available in this directory for users who prefer visual interfaces, making the tool accessible to a wider range of users.

Your contribution and feedback are welcome. Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to the development of this tool.
